# Linear Optimization Using the Simplex Method

The purpose of this project is to create an implementation of the simplex method for solving linear programming problems.

To run, open command line in the `src/` directory with Python version 3.8 or greater installed and type:

```cmd
pip install poetry;
poetry install;
poetry run python linear-optimization;
```

or in the `src/` directory:

```cmd
pip install numpy;
python linear-optimization/__main__.py;
```

This version requires pvwatts_hourly.csv and a document containing energy usage values named usage.csv in the `input/` directory, see examples.
