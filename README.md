# Linear Optimization Using the Simplex Method

The purpose of this project is to create an implementation of the simplex method for solving linear programming problems.

To run, open command line in the src directory with Python version 3.8 or greater installed and type:

```cmd
pip install poetry;

poetry install;

poetry run python linearoptimization;
```

In the current version of the program, the values for the optimization problem can be manually added to `__main.py`, future versions of the program will allow for input via a `.CSV` file.
